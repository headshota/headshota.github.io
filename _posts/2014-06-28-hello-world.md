============

Finally, I got to create my very own blog. After trying a lot of different options (Wordpress, Rails, CakePHP), I decided to go with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and must say, it is awesome! I totally recommend it to anyone, who's techy enough to install a single ruby gem and write a little bit of HTML. Also, Be sure to check [Jekyll Examples](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites), if you decide to use it.

Well as for this particular blog, I am not sure what I will be writing about. Most probably it will be a mix of my professional and personal experiences. I'm very excited to finally do this and will try to provide fun and interesting content.

Here's a picture of stegosaurus:

Oh yeah, I don't know if it will work well or not, but in the end of each blog, I will have a list of several interesting resources, be it a new tool, service, website, news item or blog post from a fellow blogger.

So here are my picks for today:

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - A very convenient and reliable way of hosting your static web pages. And guess what, it can serve Jekyll applications.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Awesomest text editor out there.
- [Simpsons CSS](http://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/) - Simpsons cartoon characters rendered with pure css.
- [Guerilla Gardening Tbilisi](https://www.facebook.com/Tbilisitrees?ref=br_tf) - A facebook page of Guerilla Gardening movement of my home city. Because nature is important!
