=====================

As of August 2014, Georgia (the country I’m from) is adopting a law of mandatory labeling for products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Though I don’t have anything against labeling on its own, the purpose of it seems not to be the one it is meant to be. The media is announcing the introduction of mandatory labeling with headlines like: “The customers will no longer be deceived”, or “The customers will be protected from GMOs”, etc. But What are the customers protected from?

There is no evidence whatsoever, proving GMO products having negative effects on health, I’m focusing on food products mostly here. Every product that was potentially harmful, was abandoned during the research phase and never ever reached the market. Besides that, we have been genetically modifying food for centuries, by cross-breeding plants and animals to make them more resistant to diseases, give larger and more nutritious fruit, make them esthetically appealing. Suddenly when breeding migrated to the lab, everybody panics. Is it really that scary? in traditional breeding we replace thousands of genes from one species with genes from another. Is it really more dangerous to replace targeted single or several genes only? Seems to me that it has to be safer.

Currently, around 1 billion people don’t have enough food. It is impossible to produce non-GMO food enough to satisfy the needs of all. Do we really prefer people dying from starvation, rather than some hypothetical cancer caused by GMOs? Yes we don’t know the long-term effects of new GMOs but that’s what scientists are for. They can predict the effects based on scientific research. We didn’t have proof for long-term effects of huge number of medications, e.g. antibiotics, but we’ve used them effectively since their discovery. The average life expectancy from early 20th century and today has grown from 31 years to 67. Major factor of it is the advances in medicine and decrease in famine after introducing GMOs.

Apart from food, GMOs are used to produce huge number of other products that are beneficial for the world. One excellent example is the genetically modified Escherichia coli bacteria are used to produce synthetic human insulin, which is used for diabetes treatment. Do we really want to lose this benefits?

So to sum it up, I really hope that people stop being afraid of GMOs and start supporting scientists to get better products in future, instead of nullifying their work by protesting against GMOs based on no actual evidence of its harmfulness. And for those staying skeptical, please, don’t trust me, open up [scholar.google.com](http://scholar.google.com) and search for numerous scientific papers.
