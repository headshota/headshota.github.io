=====================

A week ago I participated in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competition, my first ever sport competition. This was my first competition, not envolving math, physics or programming and I must say, it felt awesome, even though I lost. Here's a video of it:

I had to face a very talented young grappler, who beat me, with ease, using an "armbar", which nearly broke my arm. Bit disappointing, but what's good about it is, that I made huge improvements in my game, during preparations for this competition. And I would suggest everyone to compete more in whatever you do. It's fun and useful.

What I want to achieve in this post is to introduce you to a "cult" of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) and try to show why is it good for you.

My introduction to martial arts started with kickboxing/thai boxing, when my friend convinced me to start the class, together with him. I soon became a huge fan of the sport. Started following K1 championships actively. But after a year and a half of training, I broke my nose badly and had to undergo a long treatment. After that I never managed to find time to continue training. Though, I still actively followed the tournaments.

A while after, K1 organization went almost bankrupt, They halted the tournaments for a while and I started to transfer to Mixed Martial Arts world, Particularly UFC. Soon, as you might expect, I also got very involved in it. 

By the time I moved to Munich, Germany to do my Masters, I was already a big fan. As a guy who mostly sits in front of a screen, mostly browsing and coding, suffering from mild depression because of separation from my family and friends, I wanted do something involving physical activity. So I decided to go for the thing I was passionate about and joined a [Munich MMA](http://www.munich-mma.de/) club. Here I got introduced to BJJ and got hooked. And I mean it. It's like a drug. It is probably my number one priority in life now. Though I acknowledge that I won't be doing it professionally for obvious reasons (Started it at the age of 25), It brings immense amount of joy to my life and I think that's the most important thing to strive for.

So what's good about it? First off all, It is one of the most effective martial arts in existence. BJJ or it's similar alternative SAMBO, are a part of self defense program of major special forces all around the world. Which means that a person taking it, will eventually become:

- more confident in herself
- better at assessing risks, when dealing with dangerous situations
- less aggressive, because you leave all your aggression at the gym

Second, It's an active sport, involving the every part of your body. You will be amazed how quick your body will become tougher, more agile and flexible. And Cardio. I really cringe when I remember my first classes, when I ran to bathroom to puke, Seriously it's a hell of a workout.

And Last, but not least. It is just fun. You communicate with so many people during training, and in a way that is not regular and normal, but more intimate and scary (initially). One of the first things you learn, is to deal with the panic you will, for sure, experience when someone just smashes you on the ground, To breathe normally when being in an extreme pressure, to conserve energy and at the same time, your mind constantly focused on finding a way to get a dominant position and beat your opponent. In the beginning it felt like playing a chess game, while being chased by wolves. 

And the people, man what a community! Everybody is super friendly, trying to help you with tips during sparing. Nobody's there to hurt you, everybody is trying to improve themselves and others around. Of course there are some people who are a bit more aggressive/strong/big, but you can always polity refuse to spar and choose a partner of your desire.

So, everybody who want to do active sports and are unsure what to do, try BJJ or MMA, or any other martial art (Beware of some fake ones though!). It is not just sport, it is a way of life.
